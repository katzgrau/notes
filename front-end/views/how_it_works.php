					We say it all the time: Our primary goal was to create the easiest website authoring system for educators. 
					We made sure that every feature was intuitively easy to use, and visually appealing as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want to show you how a website is created with <Site Name>. Follow the walk-through below to see screenshots of our 
					authoring system, the site building process, and a final website. We promise, a basic website can be created in under 5 minutes!
				</p>
				<p>
					With <Site Name>, keeping in touch with parents and students electronically becomes as easy and paperless as a website update.
					Post notes, homework, contact information, letters to students and parents, and important class files!

			<h2>The Authoring Panel</h2>
			<div class="wt-text">
				<p>
					The Authoring panel is where all the website creation and editing takes place. Here, you can create and edit pages,
					change your website design, attach files, add links, and more.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you click on the image to the right, you will be able to see it larger. See how the authoring panel was designed 
					to be intuitive, but elegant and functional.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have some handy features built in, including a simple draft system, so you can work on your site without the 
					changes you make being viewable until you choose to publish.

			<h2>A Design Change in One Click</h2>
			<div class="wt-text">
				<p>
					We just had to show you how easily your website design could be changed. From the design
					browser on the settings page, just give the look of your choice a click to view your
					website with that design.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you like the way it looks, just one click sets that design to be used by your site. 
					All the content and other things you added stay intact! The only thing changes is the
					wonderful look of your website.
				</p>
				<p>
					To the right is the same website you saw previously, after the design was switched.
				</p>
				<p>
					Do you think you are ready to try <Site Name>? Head over to the <a style="font-size: 14px;" href="<?= base_url() ?>home/trial">trial page</a>.
					Or, if you would like to skip the trial process, you can <a style="font-size: 14px;" href="<?= base_url() ?>home/register">sign up now</a>!
