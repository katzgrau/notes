<h1>It worked!</h1>
<p>
	Now make sure you have taken care of the following:
	<ul>
		Getting rid of /sales, /user_guide, and /install in the system root.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Getting rid of the sandbox controller and views
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Looked over config/notes_config.php
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Set up the appropriate cron tasks (the scripts are in the system root /cron)
	</ul>
	After that, you're all set!
